This script will generate a latin square, for a given square size.

An example of a 6x6 latin square looks like this:<br>

1 2 3 4 5 6 <br>
2 3 4 5 6 1 <br>
3 4 5 6 1 2 <br>
4 5 6 1 2 3 <br>
5 6 1 2 3 4 <br>
6 1 2 3 4 5

As a fun bonus, it also generates an infinitely looping animation made up of ASCII characters, based upon the Latin square.
